# Local Load Balancer - Question Description

## Overview

Build a comprehensive local load balancing system demonstrating traffic distribution algorithms, health monitoring, circuit breaker patterns, failover mechanisms, service health endpoints, and traffic analytics. This project teaches essential concepts for building highly available and scalable distributed systems.

## Project Objectives

1. **Local Load Balancer:** Implement an in-process load balancer that distributes requests across multiple service instances, understanding load distribution strategies and instance management.

2. **Health Monitoring:** Build a health monitoring system that periodically checks service health, detects failures, marks unhealthy instances, and enables automatic recovery.

3. **Load Balancing Algorithms:** Master different load balancing algorithms including round-robin, weighted round-robin, least connections, and understand when to use each strategy.

4. **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Implement the circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures, understand state transitions (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN), and enable graceful degradation.

5. **Service Health Endpoints:** Create health check endpoints for services, implement health status reporting, and enable external health monitoring.

6. **Failover Mechanisms:** Build automatic failover systems that switch to backup instances on failure, implement failback when primary recovers, and track failover events.

7. **Traffic Analytics:** Implement comprehensive traffic tracking including request counts, error rates, response times, and traffic distribution analysis.

## Key Features to Implement

- **Load Balancing Algorithms:**
  - Round-robin for even distribution
  - Weighted round-robin for capacity-based routing

  - Periodic health checks
  - Health status tracking (Healthy, Unhealthy, Degraded)
  - Consecutive failure counting
  - Automatic recovery detection
  - Background monitoring thread

- **Circuit Breaker:**
  - Three-state implementation (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN)
  - Failure threshold configuration
  - Timeout-based recovery
  - Half-open testing with limited calls
  - State transition logging

- **Failover System:**
  - Primary/backup instance designation
  - Automatic failover on primary failure
  - Failback when primary recovers
  - Failover event history
  - Configurable failback behavior

- **Traffic Analytics:**
  - Request counting per instance
  - Success/error rate tracking
  - Response time measurement
  - Traffic distribution calculation
  - Request history logging

## Challenges and Learning Points

- **Algorithm Selection:** Understanding trade-offs between different load balancing algorithms, choosing appropriate algorithms for different scenarios, and balancing simplicity vs optimization.

- **Health Check Design:** Designing effective health checks that detect failures quickly without false positives, setting appropriate timeouts and thresholds, and handling transient failures.

- **Circuit Breaker Tuning:** Configuring failure thresholds, timeout values, and half-open call limits to balance fast failure detection with avoiding unnecessary circuit opening.

- **Failover Timing:** Deciding when to failover (immediate vs delayed), implementing smooth transitions, avoiding flapping between primary and backup, and ensuring data consistency.

- **State Management:** Managing instance state (health, connections, metrics) across concurrent requests, ensuring thread safety, and maintaining consistency.

- **Performance Overhead:** Minimizing load balancer overhead, optimizing algorithm performance, reducing health check impact, and balancing monitoring vs performance.

- **Testing Challenges:** Testing failover scenarios, simulating service failures, testing concurrent requests, and verifying algorithm correctness.
